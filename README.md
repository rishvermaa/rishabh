In case you dont know whats a MUD Game, its stands for multi user dungeon which had a very high popularity in 1970. Give it a read

How to Open the game:
Download all the files and save it in folder and open it in a IDE(Vs code/spyder/pycharm)
Run the main_script python file.
In my game i have tried to convert a castle image into an ASCII Art, you can try to convert any image but make sure it has to be in the same directory.
Follow the instruction in the game and i hope you enjoy it !!
